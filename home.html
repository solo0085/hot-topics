            <p>It may seem that money is a sure path to prestige and happiness. After all, our highest-paid citizens are held up as role models of success, living seemingly perfect, enviable lives. In recent studies, scientists have found that the relationship between wealth and well-being is unclear. While some studies link wealth to well-being, others show that, after a certain point, a higher income will not bring more happiness or life satisfaction.</p>
            <p>University at Buffalo researcher Lora Parks and her colleagues examined what happens when people associate their self-worth with financial success, scoring high on the "Financial Contingency of Self-worth" scale, or FCWS. The researchers found that by doing so, people engaged in more social comparisons, experienced more stress and anxiety, and felt less autonomy, compared to those who rated their income for income, regardless of their actual economic status. Do not bind self-worth.</p>
            <p>"People in this society are often looking for money, and they don't think there's anything bad about it," Park says. "But in terms of your psychological well-being, there are all kinds of negative consequences." It can also affect your problem-solving ability. Park and her colleagues randomly assigned participants to write about their dissatisfaction with one aspect of their financial situation – such as not having enough money to pay rent – ​​or their academic performance, such as poor. Getting test grades. Afterwards, they described what coping strategies they would use in response to the situation.</p>
            <p>Research assistants analyzed the essays and found that participants who scored higher in the FCSW used more emotionally negative words and reported more disruption strategies – such as skipping or avoiding solutions – than those who scored lower in the FCSW. When writing about a financial strain versus an academic strain in comparison. None of the results were affected by the actual income of the students. People who are facing a problem should focus on ways to solve it logically, says Park. "But what we found is that the high financial contingency of self-worth somehow blocks that response."</p>

            <p>According to the World Health Organization, foods produced using genetically modified organisms or GMOs in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating or natural recombination, are called GM foods. This technology is often referred to as 'modern biotechnology' or 'gene technology' and helps create better species as it is transferred from one organism to another and even between non-related species. There are genes to be had as well. GM-grown foods can be modified to be less resistant to insects and have a longer shelf life and better quality. Are GMO Foods Safe to Consume? The jury is still out and the debate is inconclusive. While critics argue that the use of gene technology may alter some natural characteristics of food that may have unknown adverse effects on human health, proponents of GM foods claim that they are nutritionally suitable for consumption and that some In cases, foods are more nutritious than they are. which are grown traditionally.</p>
            <p>From a food safety perspective, it makes sense to use it, but not much can be said about its health effects as more studies are needed. GM foods need to be consumed and analyzed over a long period of time to be able to verify their effects on our health, but some of them are still in their development stage. Nutritionally, they are considered safe for consumption and this has also been scientifically proven, but until we have some concrete answers, it is best to avoid them,” says consultant at Fortis-Escorts Hospital Nutritionist Dr. Rupali Dutta says, New Delhi.</p>
            <p>National authorities around the world have conducted extensive analysis and approved the production and consumption of many GM foods. The labels on some of these foods sold in supermarkets also clearly indicate that they have been genetically modified.</p>

            <p>According to new estimates, the world is expected to add another billion people within the next 15 years, from 7.3 billion in mid-2015 to 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. United Nations</p>
            <p>Currently, 60 percent of the global population lives in Asia, 16 percent in Africa, 10 percent in Europe, 9 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and only 5 percent in North America and Oceania. China and India are the largest countries in the world, which together make up about 40 percent of the world's population.</p>
            <p>But these figures will not remain like this for long. The world population is growing slowly and slowly, but it is still increasing to a great extent. Currently, the world adds about 83 million people per year, roughly equal to the population of Germany. But population growth has slowed to 1.18 percent per year from 1.24 percent a decade ago.</p>
            <p>The United Nations expects population growth to gradually stop. Global population is almost certain to increase in the short term, but the United Nations says there is a 1 in 4 chance that the world population will stabilize or fall before 2100. How accurate are these predictions? In the past, the United Nations has had a pretty good track record with its population predictions, as in 1948 it was estimated that the world population would be around 6 billion in 2000, just less than five percent from that year. It was lost.</p>
